### Teaching

##### **Winter 2023: AI/ML in the Era of Climate Change** (194.125)
*Lecturer, Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien), Austria*
- The course aims to teach students how to: (i) assess and reduce the energy and environmental impact of large scale AI models, and (ii) apply and leverage AI techniques to tackle critical climate change problems.
-   I was responsible for developing course materials and delivering the lectures, designing and grading the practical assignments and exams.

##### **Summer 2023: Data Intensive Computing** (194.048)
*Lecturer, Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien), Austria*
- The course covers topics on Big Data Processing with frameworks like MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, and SparkMLLib.
- Delivered lectures and  evaluated the student assignmetns and exams.
- Designed, and handled the three practical  assignments on (i) text retrieval with Hadoop, (ii) text analysis and classification with Spark and SparkMLLib, and (iii) edge offloading with AWS.

##### **Winter 2022: AI/ML in the Era of Climate Change** (194.125)
*Lecturer, Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien), Austria*
- I and Prof. Ivona Brandic  created this new Master's course at TU Wien.
-  The course aims to teach students how to: (i) assess and reduce the energy and environmental impact of large scale AI models, and (ii) apply and leverage AI techniques to tackle critical climate change problems.
- Developed  course syllabus, materials and delivered the lectures,  evaluating the student assignments and exams.
- Designed, implemented and handled two new practical assignments (i) exploring the tradeoffs between energy and performance with model quantization, a technique to reduce the size and complexity of neural networks, and (ii) applying deep learning models to weather forecasting using the LamaH-CE dataset.

##### **Summer 2021: Energy-efficient Distributed Systems** (194.049)
*Lecturer, Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien), Austria*
- The course covers the foundations of  sustainable computing, energy efficiency in cloud computing and edge computing systems, among others.
- Delivered lectures, designed and handled the practical assignment on prediction driven workload management in cloud data centres.
