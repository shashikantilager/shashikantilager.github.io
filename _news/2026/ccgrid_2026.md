Two papers accepted at CCGRID 2026. (1) Work on benchmarking and characterizing LLMs for energy-performance tradeoffs ([pdf](assets/pdf/publications/LLM_charecterization_ccgrid_2026.pdf)), and (2) Adaptive quantization for resource-efficient KV cache management ([pdf](assets/pdf/publications/ARKV_CCGRID_2026.pdf)). Congrats to Paul Malikael and Jianlong Lei 🎉
