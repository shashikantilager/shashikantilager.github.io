Hello World!

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [High Performance Computing (HPC)  Group](http://hpc.ec.tuwien.ac.at/), Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien), Austria. I work at the intersection of distributed systems, energy efficiency, and machine learning. In my research, I study how to design, optimize, and manage large-scale computing systems, such as cloud and edge platforms, that can support the growing demand for data-intensive and AI applications while minimizing environmental and economic costs. I ground my work in the characterization of distributed systems and optimization using learning-centric approaches. Recently, I have been exploring the energy efficiency of distributed AI applications to evaluate and improve their performance and sustainability.

Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering at the [CLOUDS Lab](http://clouds.cis.unimelb.edu.au), University of Melbourne, Australia.
