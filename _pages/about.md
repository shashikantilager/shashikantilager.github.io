Hello World!

<!-- I am an Assistant Professor in the Informatics Institute (IvI) at the University of Amsterdam (UvA). I am the member of  Multiscale Networked Systems (MNS) group. I work at the intersection of distributed systems, energy efficiency, and machine learning. In my research, I study how to design, optimize, and manage large-scale computing systems, such as cloud and edge platforms, that can support the growing demand for data-intensive and AI applications while minimizing environmental and economic costs. I ground my work in the characterization of distributed systems and optimization using learning-centric approaches. Recently, I have been exploring the energy efficiency of distributed AI applications to evaluate and improve their performance and sustainability.

Previously,  I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [High Performance Computing (HPC)  Group](http://hpc.ec.tuwien.ac.at/), Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien), Austria. Prior to that, I got my PhD in Computer Science and Engineering at the [CLOUDS Lab](http://clouds.cis.unimelb.edu.au), University of Melbourne, Australia. -->

I am an Assistant Professor at the [Informatics Institute (IvI)](https://ivi.uva.nl/) at the [University of Amsterdam (UvA)](https://www.uva.nl/en). I am a member of the [Multiscale Networked Systems (MNS)](https://mns-research.nl/) group. My research lies at the intersection of distributed systems, energy efficiency, and machine learning. I focus on designing, optimizing, and developing large-scale computing platforms—such as cloud and edge infrastructures—to minimize their environmental and economic costs. My work is grounded in characterizing distributed systems and optimizing them through data-driven, learning-centric approaches. Recently, I have been exploring the sustainability of data-intensive AI applications to enhance their performance and energy efficiency. My research has been published in leading venues including e-Energy, ASE, ICSOC, EuroPar, CCGRID, and journals such as TPDS, TMC, TC, TSC, TAAS, and TNSM.


Before joining UvA, I held postdoctoral positions at the [High Performance Computing (HPC)](http://hpc.ec.tuwien.ac.at/) group at Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien), Austria. I completed my PhD in Computer Science and Engineering at the [CLOUDS Lab](http://clouds.cis.unimelb.edu.au), University of Melbourne, Australia. Additionally, I was a visiting research scientist at IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, (Hybrid Cloud Infrastructure team) in summer 2024 and at IMT Atlantique/INRIA in winter 2023. -->

I am an Assistant Professor at the [Informatics Institute (IvI)](https://ivi.uva.nl/) at the [University of Amsterdam (UvA)](https://www.uva.nl/en) and a member of the [Multiscale Networked Systems (MNS)](https://mns-research.nl/) group. My research lies at the intersection of **distributed systems, energy efficiency, and machine learning**. I design and optimize high-performance computing platforms, from cloud to edge, with a specific focus on minimizing environmental impact. My current work focuses on the sustainability of data-intensive AI systems, aiming to decarbonize AI infrastructure and enhance energy efficiency without degrading performance.

My research and teaching contributions have been recognized with several honors, including the IEEE TCCLD Outstanding PhD Thesis Award, the IEEE Outstanding Service Award, and Best Paper Awards at CCGRID 2020 and UCC 2023, and Excellence in Teaching Award (UniMelb 2019). My research has been published in leading venues including e-Energy, ASE, ICSOC, EuroPar, and CCGRID, as well as journals such as TPDS, TMC, TC, TSC, TAAS, and TNSM.
